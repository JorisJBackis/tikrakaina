## üí° Business Model Innovation

### Solving the Micropayment Problem
Instead of charging 50 cents per prediction (which loses 60% to payment fees), we implemented:

- **Credit Packages**: ‚Ç¨5 = 12 credits, ‚Ç¨10 = 30 credits  
- **Cost per prediction**: ‚Ç¨0.33 - ‚Ç¨0.42 depending on package
- **Payment fees**: Reduced from 60% to 3-5%

### Planned Pricing Tiers
1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Credit packages for casual users
2. **Pro (‚Ç¨19/month)**: 100 predictions + PDF reports
3. **Enterprise (‚Ç¨99/month)**: Unlimited + API access + best deals finder
