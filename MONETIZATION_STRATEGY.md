# TikraKaina Monetization Strategy
## Lithuanian Real Estate Price Validation Platform

---

## Executive Summary

TikraKaina has a unique market position as the only AI-powered rental price validator in Lithuania. After analyzing the Lithuanian real estate market dynamics, **B2B-first approach targeting brokers** is the recommended primary strategy, with B2C as a secondary growth channel.

**Key Insight**: Lithuanian brokers earn €200-500 per deal. If TikraKaina helps close even 1-2 extra deals per month, a €29-99/month subscription pays for itself 10x over.
